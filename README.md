# extract-text-demo

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/osdevisnot/extract-text-demo.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)


dev setup:

``` yarn ```
``` yarn start ```


Demo: ```app.js``` has 3 chunks which import css files. With ExtractTextPlugin we are able to separate CSS from JS, but it produces only one single export.
